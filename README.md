## What is ProDentim?

ProDentim is a revolutionary oral probiotic supplement that focuses on improving dental health by restoring the natural balance of good bacteria in your mouth. Unlike traditional dental care products that often eliminate all bacteria, including the beneficial ones, ProDentim introduces 3.5 billion CFUs of helpful microorganisms to promote a healthy oral environment.

Developed with a blend of clinically proven probiotic strains, ProDentim includes Lactobacillus Paracasei, B.lactis BL-04®, and Lactobacillus Reuteri, which are known for their ability to support gum health, reduce plaque, and improve breath freshness. This supplement is specially formulated to address the root causes of dental issues rather than just masking symptoms.

ProDentim doesn’t rely on artificial chemicals or synthetic ingredients. Instead, it supports a holistic approach to oral hygiene by nurturing beneficial bacteria that protect teeth and gums from disease.

Whether you're dealing with bleeding gums, chronic bad breath, or frequent dental infections, ProDentim offers a natural solution. It works effectively alongside your regular oral care routine to improve long-term dental wellness and overall mouth comfort.

## How Does ProDentim Work?

ProDentim works by targeting the root cause of oral health problems—imbalanced bacteria in the mouth. Most dental issues, including bad breath, gum disease, and plaque, are linked to a disrupted oral microbiome. ProDentim restores that balance using probiotics and supportive nutrients.

Once taken, ProDentim releases 3.5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of beneficial bacteria. These strains, including Lactobacillus Paracasei, Lactobacillus Reuteri, and B.lactis BL-04®, colonize the oral cavity. They fight off harmful bacteria, reduce inflammation, and help strengthen gum tissues.

The inclusion of Inulin, a prebiotic fiber, ensures that these good bacteria are well-nourished and continue to thrive. Inulin also contributes to a more balanced pH level in the mouth, which is crucial for maintaining enamel and preventing acid-related erosion.

Other ingredients like Malic Acid from fruits gently polish the teeth and support saliva production, which is essential for neutralizing bacteria and cleansing the mouth. Tricalcium Phosphate plays a key role in remineralizing tooth enamel, providing extra protection against cavities and sensitivity.

Peppermint not only refreshes breath but also delivers antimicrobial benefits, helping reduce the presence of harmful pathogens in the mouth. Unlike harsh mouthwashes, ProDentim works gently and naturally without disrupting the oral environment.

With daily use, ProDentim builds a strong foundation for oral health, preventing future problems and ensuring a cleaner, fresher, and more resilient smile. The formula is non-GMO, gluten-free, and manufactured in FDA-registered facilities, making it a reliable choice for all ages.

## ProDentim Ingredients

What sets ProDentim apart is its powerful combination of probiotics and natural ingredients. Each element is carefully selected to work in harmony, targeting the core of dental issues and promoting long-term oral health.

**Lactobacillus Paracasei**

A vital probiotic that supports healthy gums, reduces inflammation, and aids in preventing periodontal issues. It helps balance the oral microbiome, improving overall mouth health.

**B.lactis BL-04®**

This strain supports the immune system and enhances the protective layer of good bacteria in the mouth. It’s known to reduce harmful pathogens that contribute to cavities and infections.

**Lactobacillus Reuteri**

Helps reduce gum bleeding and inflammation while supporting a stable bacterial balance. It is especially beneficial for those suffering from gum sensitivity or discomfort.

**Tricalcium Phosphate**

An essential mineral that strengthens tooth enamel and protects against decay. It also supports bone health and remineralization of weakened areas on the teeth.

Naturally refreshing, peppermint not only provides a clean taste but also offers antimicrobial benefits, helping to eliminate the bacteria responsible for bad breath and infections.

This unique blend makes ProDentim one of the most effective and safest oral supplements on the market.
